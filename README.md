# Information
This lightweight script disables players from shuffling seats in vehicles. Normally in GTA/FiveM, when a player enters a vehicle from the passenger side, the player would automaticlly transfer to the driver seat. This script prevents that from happening. If a player gets into an emtpy vehicle from the passenger side, they will remain in that seat.

# How To Use
1. Download via Github
2. Open Zipped Folder
3. Open 'MD_NoSuffle-main' folder
4. Drag 'md_noshuffle' to your 'resources' folder
5. Add 'start noshuffle' or 'ensure noshuffle' (depending server version) to your server.cfg file
6. Start Server

# Support
There is no support for this script as it's a very basic script and offers no customization or speical features. If this script isn't working for you than either you installed it incorrectly or there has been an update to FiveM and how it handles event listeners. If that is the case, please report an issue and we will update the script for all.
